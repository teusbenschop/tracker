Reducing the number of areas.

If a larger area is marked, all containing areas are wiped and replaced with the larger one.

Make a menu to call a procedure to join areas into one to reduce the number of areas.

If drawing a new covered area, and it entirely overlays existing areas, then those existing areas will be removed and effectually replaced by the larger area. This may significantly reduce the areas if used wisely.

















Make a label "About" and update it with diagnostics info, e.g. how many location updates were received, when the app goes to the foreground. Make sure to switch it off again.

On move to foreground, update the "About" label with the location count.








If tracking and following are off, then make things very efficient in the background so it uses hardly any power.






















Have a button "Park (vehicle)" and implement it.







Add more actions to the journal.

Check what happens if location permission is refused.
The app should then give a popup with information about that situation.





Extra info, like:
1. How many points the track consists of.
2. How many areas have been marked complete.
3. ...




On startup, it starts updating locations.
But this is not needed normally.
Therefore make something like a timer that switches that off if not tracking.




Accept donations in the app.

If no donation is given yet, present a dialog once in, say, half a year or so.
Easily dismissable with "Not now"
