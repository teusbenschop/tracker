Reducing the number of areas.

If a larger area is marked, all containing areas are wiped and replaced with the larger one.

Make a menu to call a procedure to join areas into one to reduce the number of areas.

If drawing a new covered area, and it entirely overlays existing areas, then those existing areas will be removed and effectually replaced by the larger area. This may significantly reduce the areas if used wisely.

















Make a label "About" and update it with diagnostics info, e.g. how many location updates were received, when the app goes to the foreground. Make sure to switch it off again.

Then update location delegate so on background it stores then locations in array only, or say, only count the number.
Then take the app along on a journey.
Then on move to foreground, update the "About" label with the location count.
If ok, then start drawing stuff on move to foreground.
That will check the entire route.

While in the background, it receives the location updates,
stores the locations, but does not draw them on the map.
It will draw the cached locations on the map when it goes to the foreground.

It stores the track in the app settings, perhaps a database. This persists them.
If the app starts, and the track has not yet been drawn, it draw the track from the database.
This is more robust for crashes too.

If tracking and following are off, then make things very efficient in the background so it uses hardly any power.

In the background, it never follows the user that is, it does not move the map camera.





















Have app background permissions, it won't draw on the map, it will just record the track, and draw the remainder on the map once it moves to the foreground.









Check on whether make locationManager.desiredAccuracy settable via menu.








Have four tracking states, one extra not displaying user location at all?




Have a button "Park (vehicle)" and implement it.



For receiving background location updates, does it need "Always location" permissions. Somewhere it says it does not need those if the background service is properly done.



Add more actions to the journal.



Keep updating the polygon while dragging?

Later nog mogelijkheid maken om als het waren rond een gebied te "tekenen" met de vinger om een ruwe polylijn neer te zetten om te starten. Kan door te starten, dan met "tap" annotaties neer te zetten, en dan steeds verder, en dan knopje voor "klaar". Dit vereist een andere database layout.













Make setting in the app that it has vertical layout as normal, and that it has portrait mode.

Check what happens if location permission is refused.
The app should then give a popup with information about that situation.





Extra info, like:
1. How many points the track consists of.
2. How many areas have been marked complete.
3. ...




On startup, it starts updating locations.
But this is not needed normally.
Therefore make something like a timer that switches that off if not tracking.
