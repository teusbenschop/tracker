If enable tracking, then request location again to update stuff.


The Map() may be slow if there's many annotations due to redrawing them.
Better use MKMapView for performance.

Start with writing annotations for the users' track.
Annotations should be as cheap as possible for writing, no fancy stuff, for better performance.

See how to write a number of dots to indicate the walked track. That is, how to add basic annotations live. Likely have a container with annotatons, and update that container, so the Stete will write them onto the map. Or something like this.
Display an updating path of a user's location history.

See if animating the map helps, make a setting for that too, as it may use more energy.
Button for whether the maps follows the user.
This button is that setting too.


Mapkit overlays.

If app starts, the location give an error. So then on enabling tracking, update this so it gives a green arrow, not a red one.




Ideas
=====

Once areas get covered, there's more and more annotations to draw.
Will that affect performance?
Mitigating measures:
* Draw the covered areas only in the visible area.
* Make a menu to call a procedure to join areas into one to reduce the number of areas.
* If drawing a new covered area, and it entirely overlays existing areas, then those existing areas will be removed and effectually replaced by the larger area. This may significantly reduce the areas if used wisely.

While drawing the track,
intelligently decide whether to replace the last drawn annotation with the current annotation.
This reduces the number of dots drawn.
And improves, likely, the performance.

Use MagSafe powerbank for extra power.

Have a setting to keep the screen unlocked.

Have app background permissions, it won't draw on the map, it will just record the track, and draw the remainder on the map once it moves to the foreground.
