// Basic location manager object.
// This object is the delegate of the Core Location location manager.
// This object will pass updates to CLLocationManager to the app.
// On the iOS simulator, the app won't ask for permissions to use the location.
// This permission can be granted from the terminal:
// $ xcrun simctl privacy "iPhone 12" grant location-always org.bibledit.ios.test
