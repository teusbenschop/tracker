// Method for linking data and views:
// 1. Create view model classes for the different features of the app.
// 2. These classes conform to the ObservableObject protocol.
// 3. Define singleton objects in the top of the view hierarchy with @StateObject.
// $. Pass the singletons down as environment objects.
// This frees the developer from the pain of bindings and general coupling in the code structure.


@main
struct FlyeringApp: App {
    
    @StateObject private var mapModel = MapViewModel()
    @StateObject private var locationManager = LocationManager()
    @StateObject private var status = Status()
    @StateObject private var trackManager = TrackManager()
    @StateObject private var markAreaReady = MarkAreaReady()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            MainView()
                .environmentObject(mapModel)
                .environmentObject(locationManager)
                .environmentObject(status)
